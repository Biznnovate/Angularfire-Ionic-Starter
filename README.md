# Angularfire-Ionic-Starter
This is repo that is a starting point for people looking into using ionic with firebase w/ storage and auth implemented.

This is a simple example which should get you going with a new firebase/ionic application.

# Demo
There is a live demo hosted with firebase [here](https://angularfire-ionic-starter.firebaseapp.com/), you can toggle a switch and upload files. Nothing fancy, but should demo everything that this starter can help you do!

# Setup
There is not too much setup to get this project going.

Firstly, fork this repo (by clicking the fork button). Next, clone the repo with `git clone URL_HERE`.
You will also need to have nodeJS installed.
Dependencies: ionic, bower, firebase-cli (if hosting with firebase)

## Firebase Configuration
Firebase Config
Firebase Deploy

## Renaming Application and Info
You will need to add you application name to a few files (if you care).

#Disclaimer
This is a personal starter template that I use for my projects. It is by no means perfect, but should get you up and running in no time at all! Feel free to use this however you want, a quick mention is awesome if you want to - but is not necessary.
